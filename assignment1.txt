NOTE -> You Have to Solve each question in all the possible ways you can think of .
(even if its just a brute force solution you have to write that and have to figure out the complexcities and write that in comment)

Also NOTE - if input is not explicitly mentioned to be in some order or of some special type assume that it could be in anyway


1) write a function to return if the given number in prime or not. 

2) write a function to return the factorial of a number.

3) Given a string you have to sort the string with the following condition.
 
   Sample Input -> "t9ex8t7709721334AAID"
   Ouput - > "AADIettx01233477789"

   Explanation -> all the uppercase letter will be sorted and come in front , followed by sorted lowercase letter and then sorted numbers


4) write the function to return all the possible increasing sublist of a given list.
      e.g - A = [2,3,4]
	o/p - > [[],2,[2,3],[2,4],[2,3,4],[3],[3,4],[4]]



5) write a function to merge two sorted array without taking any extra space.( This is Self explanatory)

6) Ajay is a naughtyboy and always try to take his inncocent angel like trainer :( for a ride after he fails to complete all his assignments,
   He got an idea to put all the solved questions in front followed by failedtestcases/(wrong answers) , followed by unsolved questions ,
   hoping the trainer would only look for few problems from the top since he thinks trainer is little lazy . You have to help Ajay achive the
   idea out of randomly placed questions. (very easy question , self explanatory so not giving any explanation and sample i/p-o/p)

7) find the maximum sum of a increasing subarray of numbers.

      i/p - [2,5,6,1]
      o/p - 14

              (Think properly and carefully)
